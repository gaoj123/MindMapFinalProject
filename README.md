<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Mind Mapping is a program that allows users to organize ideas by creating visual outlines. Users can select an outline style or a blank document to add various topics to. Each individual topic can create a sibling or subtopic in whatever branching direction selected.</p>
<br>
<ul><h3>Keys in Processing, Hit: </h3>
<li>'f' to add a floating topic</li>
<li>'w' to edit text</li>
<li>'s' to add a subtopic to a SELECTED topic</li>
<li>'z' to add a sibling topic to a SELECTED topic</li>
<li>RETURN to deselect</li>
</ul><br><br>
<ul><h3>Data Storage</h3>
<li>Each topic has an ArrayList of topics (subtopics) (done Saturday 6/3)</li>
</ul><br><br>
<ul><h3><b>User Inputs Topics </b></h3>
<li>Initial Plan: there are buttons to choose to add subtopics, floating topics, and siblings.  Once clicked, a text field appears (not working currently) (done Saturday 6/3)</li>
<li>Now: Refer to above "Keys in Processing, Hit: " to learn how to create topics and edit the text of topics</li>
</ul><br><br>
<ul><h3>Labels on Diagram</h3>
<li>When keys are pressed for new floating topics/subtopics/siblings to be created, coordinates will be generated for those new topics (some seemed to work on Saturday 6/3 but lots of problems arose as I [Jenny] started testing and trying out all possible cases so they work as of 6/11). </li>
<li>Lines appear at these coordinate locations, and users can choose to edit the (blank) text</li>
</ul>
